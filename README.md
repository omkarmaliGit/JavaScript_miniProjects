<h1>JavaScript Mini Projects</h1>
Welcome to my HTML-CSS-JavaScript Mini Projects repository! Here, I showcase a series of mini projects where I create popular interfaces using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These projects are an excellent way for me to hone my front-end development skills and gain hands-on experience in building visually appealing web pages.

<h2>Project Highlights</h2>
JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, and it plays a crucial role in web development. This repository is designed to get hands-on experience by building small-scale projects that cover various aspects of JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous programming, and more.
